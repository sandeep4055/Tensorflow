# Tensorflow
<p>TensorFlow is an open-source framework from Google for creating Machine Learning models. Although the software is written in C++, it is otherwise language-independent and can therefore be used very easily in various programming languages. For many users, the library has now become the standard for Machine Learning, since common models can be built comparatively simply. In addition, state-of-the-art ML models can also be used via TF, such as various transformers.</p>

# What are Tensors?
<p>The name TensorFlow may seem a bit strange at first since there is no direct connection to Machine Learning. However, the name comes from the so-called tensors, which are used to train Deep Learning models and therefore form the core of TF.</p>

<p>The tensor is a mathematical function from linear algebra that maps a selection of vectors to a numerical value. The concept originated in physics and was subsequently used in mathematics. Probably the most prominent example that uses the concept of tensors is general relativity.</p>

<p>In the field of Machine Learning, tensors are used as representations for many applications, such as images or videos. In this way, a lot of information, some of it multidimensional, can be represented in one object. An image, for example, consists of a large number of individual pixels whose color value in turn is composed of the superposition of three color layers (at least in the case of RGB images). This complex construction can be represented compactly with a tensor.</p>
