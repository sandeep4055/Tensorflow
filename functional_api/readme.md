# Functional API 

The TensorFlow functional API is a higher-level API for building complex models with TensorFlow. It allows for the creation of more flexible and sophisticated models than the Sequential API, which only supports linear stacks of layers.

Here are some key features of the TensorFlow functional API:

1. Support for multiple inputs and outputs: The functional API allows for the creation of models that have multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs, making it possible to build complex architectures that can handle more complex tasks.

2. Layer sharing: It is possible to share layers across multiple models or inputs using the functional API. This can be useful for creating models that use the same layer to process different inputs, or for building more complex models that have shared layers.

3. Non-sequential models: Unlike the Sequential API, the functional API allows for the creation of non-sequential models. This means that the output of one layer can be connected to the input of any other layer in the model, making it possible to build more complex and flexible architectures.

4. Model subclassing: The functional API also supports model subclassing, which allows for even greater flexibility in model creation. With subclassing, you can define your own custom layers and models, making it possible to build models that are not possible with the pre-defined layers in TensorFlow.

5. Support for custom training loops: The functional API also allows for the creation of custom training loops, which can be useful for more complex training scenarios that require greater control over the training process.

Overall, the functional API provides a more flexible and powerful way to build models in TensorFlow, and is particularly useful for more complex tasks that require more sophisticated architectures.
