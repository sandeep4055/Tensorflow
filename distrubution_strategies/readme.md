# Distribution Strategies

- In TensorFlow, distribution strategies are used to train models across multiple devices or machines, enabling parallelism and scalability. They allow you to take advantage of multiple GPUs or multiple machines to accelerate training and improve performance. Here are some distribution strategies available in TensorFlow:

1. **MirroredStrategy:** This strategy is used for synchronous training on multiple GPUs within a single machine. It creates copies of the model on each GPU and divides the input data among them. The gradients are computed on each GPU independently and then aggregated to update the model weights. MirroredStrategy uses all-reduce algorithms to synchronize the variables and gradients across GPUs.

2. **ParameterServerStrategy:** This strategy is designed for training on multiple machines. It involves multiple workers and one or more parameter servers. The model variables are split across parameter servers, and each worker is responsible for computing gradients on a subset of the training data. The gradients are then sent to the parameter servers for aggregation and updating the model weights.

3. **MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy:** This strategy extends MirroredStrategy to training on multiple machines with multiple GPUs. It combines the synchronous training of MirroredStrategy with the distributed training of ParameterServerStrategy. It can be used in scenarios where you have multiple workers with multiple GPUs on each worker.

4. **CentralStorageStrategy:** This strategy is used for training on a single machine with multiple GPUs. It places variables on one device (typically the CPU) and keeps a single copy of the model on that device. Gradients are computed on each GPU independently and then aggregated on the CPU to update the model weights.

These distribution strategies help in scaling up training to larger models and datasets, reducing training time, and utilizing available hardware resources efficiently. They provide flexibility to choose the strategy based on the hardware configuration and the scale of your training setup.
